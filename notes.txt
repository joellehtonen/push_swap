optimize assing_cost later to only do a part of list, in case the list is very long. 

store next value (or its index???) somewhere in the node, so you dont need to look for it twice

MAKE A SEPARATE FUNCTION TO CHECK WHETHER TO R OR TO RR
	true if first half of the list
	false if latter half of the list

NEED TO OPTIMIZE a bit

cost value does not calculate that you can use RR and RRR

SPLIT the big functions

why the code needs rotate max up? FIX THIS
