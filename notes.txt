split to cut up a big argument within ""
what if there both numbers and a string? 
DO THIS NEXT SO YOU CAN RUN CHECKER

MAYBE change lstclear to use while loops instead of recursion (possible problem with stack overflow if recursion goes too deep)
(check first if this is actually a problem with 5000 or more nodes)

optimize assing_cost later to only do a part of list, in case the list is very long. 

store next value (or its index???) somewhere in the node, so you dont need to look for it twice

MAKE A SEPARATE FUNCTION TO CHECK WHETHER TO R OR TO RR
	true if first half of the list
	false if latter half of the list

SEGFAULTS WITH BIG ARRAYS OF NUMBERS

NEED TO OPTIMIZE

cost value does not calculate that you can use RR and RRR

dont move from A if in descending check_order
	flag?

why the code needs rotate max up?
