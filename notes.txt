how to check 0s?
so that 0 and 00 and +000 and -00 are not acceptable
neither is 002 and 02 and 0002
but 01 and 023 and 0002 are?

make sure that your check_min_max checks for excessive zeros that might fool strlen and atoi
so that 000000000000 or -00000000000001 dont fail the test

should I have an alternative value for the nodes, min value 1, max value being len
easier to process?

do I need to keep len for any purpose?

split to cut up a big argument within ""
what if there both numbers and a string?

incorpote your own ft_printf (adjust makefile)

MAYBE change lstclear to use while loops instead of recursion (possible problem with stack overflow if recursion goes too deep)
(check first if this is actually a problem with 5000 or more nodes)

write up an exception for arguments less than 5ish

sort-three: all possible cases
1, 2, 3
= no need to be sorted
1, 3, 2
= rra (213), sa
2, 1, 3
= sa
2, 3, 1
= rra
3, 1, 2
= ra
3, 2, 1
= ra (213), sa

sort 4
stack_a		stack_b
1			4
